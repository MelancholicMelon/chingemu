# Type Racer
## Game feature
Players are typing the same sentences and can see each other's progress bar while each other are typing.
Simultaneously, there is a chat room on the left side of the app.
The server assigsn the client name, so each player are anonymous but can see who each other are.
## Socket.io Functions
The client would send progress of the user to the server as they type.
The server would then broadcast the progress from all users to all users.
The client would then render the progress 

## Running Code
App.js and server.js alone should be enough to run this game, 
there are no extraneous node modules installed.
